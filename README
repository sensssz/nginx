INSTALLTION OF NGINX

The installation of Nginx requires only three steps:
1. cd $ngx_folder;
2. auto/configure --prefix=$prefix;
3. make install

After this, Nginx will be installed in $prefix/sbin/. By default Nginx uses port 80, therefore it requires sudo permission.
The port can be changed in the configuration in order to run Nginx without sudo access. The configuaration file is located at $prefix/conf/nginx.conf.

To start Nginx, simply run
$prefix/sbin/nginx

To stop it, run
$prefix/sbin/nginx -s stop
